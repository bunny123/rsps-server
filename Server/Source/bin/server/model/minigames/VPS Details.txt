You will have to login to your registrar and find the area where you can specify both of your custom name server addresses.

After adding these custom nameservers to your domain registrar control panel, it will take 24 to 48 hours for your domain to delegate authority to your DNS server. Once this has taken effect, your DNS server has control over the DNS records for the domains which use your custom name server addresses.
